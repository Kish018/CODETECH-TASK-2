### Overview of the Project

### Project : PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

### Objective

The objective of this project is to perform a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

### Key Activities
**Import Necessary Libraries:** Libraries -numpy, pandas, matplotlib, train_test_split, LinearRegression, mean_squared_error, r2_score.
**Load the Dataset:** Create a synthetic dataset.

**Split and Train the Model :** Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the Linear Regression Model.

**Correlation Analysis:** Identifying correlations between population figures across different years.
**Make Predictions and visualize Results:** Make predictions on the test set, evaluate the model by calculating metrices, Visualize the results and plot the Regression Line.

### Technologies Used

**Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis.

**pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.

**matplotlib:** Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

**train_test_split:** Split the dataset into test set, train and test the model.
